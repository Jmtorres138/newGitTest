Hey sit down and listen and they'll tell you when you're wrong
Eradicate but vindicate as progess creeps along
Puritan work ethic maintains its subconscious edge 
As Old Glory maintains your consciousness 

There is a loser in the house 
And a puppet on the stool
And a clouded way of life 
And a black refecting pool
And as the people bend
There moral Fabric dies
A country can't pretend to ignore it's peoples' cries

'CAUSE YOU ARE THE GOVERNMENT
YOU ARE JURISPRUDENCE 
YOU ARE THE VOLITION
YOU ARE JURISTICTION
